# **Example of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System**

## **Overview**
Simple implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using Python. The RAG approach combines two important components:
1. **Retrieval**: Finds relevant documents from a corpus of text that match a user's query.
2. **Generation**: Generates a natural language response using the retrieved document as context.

A basic **TF-IDF** model if used here for the retrieval phase and a pre-trained **GPT-2** model for the generation phase.

## **How it Works**
The system works in three main steps:

1. **Query Input**: The user provides a query or question.
2. **Document Retrieval**: A TF-IDF model retrieves the most relevant document from a predefined set of documents based on the similarity between the query and the documents.
3. **Response Generation**: A GPT-2 model uses the retrieved document and the query to generate a context-aware response.

## **Requirements**
Before running the code, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip`:

```bash
pip install transformers scikit-learn
```

### **Dependencies**:
- `transformers`: For loading and using the pre-trained GPT-2 model for text generation.
- `scikit-learn`: For building the TF-IDF-based document retrieval model.

## **Usage**

### **1. Example Documents**
The code uses a small set of sample documents to demonstrate the RAG functionality. You can modify these or load a larger set of documents depending on your use case:

### **2. Running the RAG System**

To generate a response based on a query, simply run the following code:

## **Customization**

- **Documents**: You can update the `documents` list with your own dataset. Ideally, this should contain several documents or chunks of information that your system will retrieve from.
  
- **Model**: This example uses the small GPT-2 model (`gpt2`). For better results, you could use larger models like `gpt2-medium` or `gpt-3` if available.
  
- **Retrieval Method**: The current system uses TF-IDF for simplicity. In production, you can replace this with more sophisticated retrievers like **Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)** or other **neural retrieval models**.

## **Future Improvements**
To make this system more robust and production-ready, consider:
- Integrating a more advanced retriever such as **DPR** or **BM25**.
- Using a more advanced generation model, like **GPT-3** or **GPT-4**.
- Adding a larger dataset or real-time knowledge base for document retrieval.
- Implementing caching or pre-indexing for large-scale datasets to improve retrieval performance.
